# robust-AMDP
This project is for ICML 2025 accepted paper "Provable Policy Gradient for Robust Average-Reward MDPs Beyond Rectangularity"
## Rectangular RAMDPs
This experiment is implemented with [sa-retangular ambiguity set](https://github.com/Charliez7/robust-AMDP/blob/main/sa_comparison_for_amdp.py)
## Runtime Comparison
This is conducted with [runtime](https://github.com/Charliez7/robust-AMDP/blob/main/runtime.py)
## General RAMDPs
This comparison is based on the ellipsoid ambiguity set with ```nonrec_robust_comparison```
