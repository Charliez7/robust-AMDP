# robust-AMDP
This project is for ICML 2025 accepted paper "Provable Policy Gradient for Robust Average-Reward MDPs Beyond Rectangularity"
## Rectangular RAMDPs
This experiment is implemented with ```sa_comparison_for_amdp.py```.
## Runtime Comparison
This is conducted with ```runtime.py```.
## General RAMDPs
This comparison is based on the ellipsoid ambiguity set with ```nonrec_robust_comparison.py```.
## Inventory Control
This experiment follows the steps with 
> 1) data sampling:```ic_data.py```;
> 2) policy computing:```ic_policy.py```;
> 3) performance comparison:```ic_test.py```.
